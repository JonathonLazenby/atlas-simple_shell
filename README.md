# Simple Shell

**Description:**
A shell in an extremely basic form, meant to do similar stuff as Unix. Command line interpreter/interface between user
and kernel. executing programs called commands to navigate the system. Supposed to prompt you to enter a command, pa-
rse through what was entered, look for either a system call in the environment or built-in command included in your compiled files, finish executing whichever is chosen within the child process, then finish the parent process and loop back to the prompt.
for example: user enters ls and executes to see a list of current files/directories in the current working directory.

**Purpose:**
To showcase what we have learned in these last few months, while also showing where we can improve.
